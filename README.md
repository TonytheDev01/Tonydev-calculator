# Tonydev-calculator
put into practice what i learned, the basic of javascripts: functions, operators, comments...
I structured the calculator using HTML
Styled it with CSS
And add functionality to it with javaScript
I performed basic operations with the calculator to test if it's working
And it did work perfectly
